# simple_library
With the promps of setting up a simple IoC library within a two hour timeframe, I opted to use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for a boilerplate template so I could focus more of my time on programming.
Using an established framework to call the sections of code I register seemed like the straight-forward way of demonstrating IoC concepts in a limited amoutn of time.

## To Begin
In your terminal, navigate to the simple_library directory.
I recommend first running the command `npm install` to ensure all of your dependencies are up to date. 
Once the update has completed, run the command `npm start` to run the application.
Since I am trying to stay within the two hour time limit, my program may not work perfectly or at all.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
